# PREP-Drawing-Html
This chapter [Murray 5] covers the core of the d3 algorithm. For your prep create a page to explain how some of the pieces work. In particular, explain what the select, append, text,style commands do. People wishing to do more should demonstrate the full effect by using d3 to generate some html (doesn't have to be very complex).
